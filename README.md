# sparkdocs

My knowledgebase, in asciidoc.

## Synopsis

**NOTE:** This project is a work in progress. I hope that it some day helps
developers and CS students alike, and that folks contribute.

The motivation is simple - transcribe my notes to asciidoc.

Slideshows, word processor documents, and such are not as processable as I would
like.
