== Recent Versions

* Java 13/14 (early access builds): released end of July 2019
* Java 12: released March 2019
* Java 11 (LTS): released in September 2018

== LTS Releases

A *Long Term Support (LTS)* release is a version of Java that will remain
the industry standard for several years.

Example: Java 8

* Released in 2014
* Updates until 2020
* Extended support ends by 2025

== Changelog

=== Java 8

* Big changes

* Streams API
** Supports many parallel operations to process data
** Chooses the best low-level execution mechanism
** Avoids the need to write code that uses `synchronized`
*** Not only highly error-prone, but also more expensive on multicore CPUs

* Concise techniques to pass code to methods (method references, lambdas)
** AKA functional-style programming

* Default methods on interfaces

<<<

=== Java 9

* Java Platform module system
** Modular JAR files contain an additional module descriptor.
*** In this module descriptor, dependencies on other modules are expressed
through `requires` statements
*** Additionally, `exports` statements control which packages are accessible
to other modules
*** Allows for encapsulation

* Linking
** `jlink` tool to use module dependencies to create a minimal runtime
environment, containing just those modules necessary to run your application

* JShell
** Interactive Java REPL (read-eval-print loop)

* Collection factory methods (`Map.of()`, etc.)

=== Java 10

* The `var` type
** Not a keyword, but a type!
** It introduces local-variable type inference to the language
** It figures out at compile-time the reference type based on the value type

* Unmodifiable collection enhancements

* Garbage-First Garbage Collection (G1GC) improvements
** Introduction of full parallel processing during a Full GC

* New JIT compiler
** Written entirely in Java (as opposed to C++)
** Only usable on Linux boxes and must be enabled

* Thread-local handshakes
** The JVM can put an arbitrary number of threads into a safepoint
** Threads may continue running after performing the prescribed "handshake"
** The result is that the JVM can pause just one thread at a time, whereas
before it had to pause them all

* Container awareness
** The JVM now knows when it is running inside a Docker container
** It is aware about what the docker container allocates to memory, CPU,
and other system resources

<<<

=== Java 11

* Lots of changes

* The deployment stack required for running applets and web applications has
been removed from JDK
** Deprecated since JDK 9
** Browser support removed due to unavailability of deployment stack

* Auto-update has been removed from JRE installations in Windows and MacOS

* JavaFX and Java Mission Control is now available as a separate download

* Java language translation for French, German, Italian, Korean,
Portuguese (Brazilian), Spanish, and Swedish is no longer provided

* In this version, JRE and Server JRE are no longer offered
** Only JDK is offered

* Updated distribution packaging format (Oracle Java)
** For Windows has changed from tar.gz to .zip
** For macOS has changed from .app to .dmg

* New String methods
** `isBlank()`, `repeat()`, `lines()`, `stripLeading()`, `stripTrailing()`,
`strip()`

* New `File` methods
** `writeString()`, `readString()`, `isSameFile()`

* Pattern recognizing methods
** `asMatchPredicate()`

* New `Optional` methods

* Epsilon Garbage Collector
** Handles memory allocation but does not have a memory reclamation mechanism
** Once the available Java heap is exhausted, JVM will shut down

* Time unit conversion

* Removal of `Thread.stop()` and `Thread.destroy()` methods

* Local-variable (`var`) syntax for lambda parameters

== Climate Change

As new features are added to rapidly evolving languages, e.g. JavaScript,
they can eventually influence more stable ones such as Java.
