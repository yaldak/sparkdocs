== Highlights

* An interface is a *reference data type* (similar to a class)
** Can use interface names like any other data type name

* An interface can only contain:
*** Constants
*** Method signatures
*** Default methods
*** Static methods
*** Nested types

* *Method bodies only exist for default and static methods*

* Cannot be instantiated, but:
** Can be implemented by classes
** Can be extended by other interfaces

== Declaration

* An interface declaration consists of:
** Modifiers
** The keyword `interface`
** The interface name
** Any interfaces it extends

* A `public` access modifier indicates visibility to any class, in any package

* *Default visibility is package-private*, if `public` is omitted
** package-private interfaces are only visible to classes in the same package

* Interfaces support *multiple inheritance*
** A class can extend only one other class
** An interface can extend any number of interfaces, separated by commas

<<<

== Body of an Interface

* Can contain abstract, default, and static methods
** Abstract methods
*** Do not contain an implementation
*** Followed by a semicolon, but no braces
** Default methods
*** Defined with the `default` modifier
** Static methods
*** Defined with the `static` keyword

* Sans `abstract`, `default`, or `static`, *methods are implicitly abstract*

* *All methods are implicitly `public`*
** Can omit the `public` access modifier
** Different from class methods, where default visibility is package-private

* Can contain constant value declarations
** Implicitly `public`, `static`, and `final`
** Can omit these modifiers

=== Basic Example

[source,java,linenums]
----
public interface Edible
{
    int getCalories();

    boolean expiresBefore(Date date);
}
----

<<<

== Usage

Any object assigned to a reference variable whose type is an interface must be
an instance of a class that implements that interface.

This example demonstrates the difference between using a *declared type vs.
an actual type*.

Observe that:

* `isFriendlyWith()`, defined in `Animal`, takes an object of type `Animal`
** `Cat` implements `Animal`; therefore, `Cat` is an `Animal`

* `Cat.isFriendlyWith()` cannot call `getTemper()` without a cast

=== Code

[source,java]
----
public interface Animal {
    boolean isFriendlyWith(Animal other);
}

public class Cat implements Animal {
    private int temper;

    public Cat(int temper) {
        this.temper = temper;
    }

    public int getTemper() {
        return this.temper;
    }

    @Override // Optional, promotes explicitness
    public boolean isFriendlyWith(Animal other) {
        if (other instanceof Cat) {
            // Cannot call getTemper() without a cast
            // Its method body only exists in the actual type Cat
            return ((Cat) other.getTemper()) < 5;
        }

        return false;
    }
}

== Multiple Inheritance

* *Java classes do not support multiple inheritance*
** Including abstract classes

* A class can only extend one class, but *can implement multiple interfaces*
** This can lead to a hierarchical, brittle inheritance structure

* However, *interfaces can extend multiple other interfaces*
** This allows for the construction of *hierarchical type frameworks*

* Type hierarchies can be useful for organization
** Not all structures fall neatly into a rigid hierarchy

=== Example: Non-hierarchical Structure

[source,java]
----
public interface Singer {
    AudioClip sing(Song song);
}

public interface Songwriter {
    Song compose(int chartPosition);
}

public interface SingerSongwriter extends Singer, Songwriter {
    AudioClip strum();
    void emote();
}
----

* Note the absence of method access modifiers, which default to `public`
** Remember, this is not the default method access modifier for classes

* This level of flexibility isn't always needed, but can be helpful

* The choice of interface inheritance makes sense in this scenario
** There is not a strict hierarchy for inheritance

<<<

=== Anti-patterns

* The *alternative is a bloated class hierarchy*
** Undesirable to create a separate class for every supported combination of
attributes (combinatorial explosion)

* If there are latexmath:[n] attributes in the type system, then there are
latexmath:[2^n] possible combinations you would have to support

* Bloated class hierarchies can lead to bloated classes with many methods
** The methods would differ only in the type of their arguments
** There would be no types in the class hierarchy to capture common behaviors

* This does not mean that you should avoid inheritance
** *Choose the right pattern for the problem you are trying to solve*

* Questions to ponder:
** Would `Singer` inherit from `Songwriter`, or `Songwriter` from `Singer`?
** Who is the parent?

==== Why not Composition or Aggregation?

[source,java]
----
// Is a singer composed of a songwriter?
public class Songwriter {
    public Song compose(int chartPosition);
}

public class Singer {
    Songwriter songwriter = new Songwriter();
}

// Is a songwriter composed of a singer?
public class Singer {
    AudioClip sing(Song song);
}

public class Songwriter {
    Singer singer = new Singer();
}
----

Composition and aggregation are about one class being a property or belonging to
another class.

They does not make sense in this context as an alternative to interfaces.

== Default Methods

* Ideally, interfaces should be designed for posterity

* Before Java 8, adding an abstract method to an interface breaks all
implementing classes

* As of Java 8, the *default method construct* was added to interfaces
** A `default` method does not need to be re-implemented in a concrete class
*** If not re-implemented, it is inherited from the interface

* Default methods allow:
** Addition of new functionality to interfaces
** Binary compatibility with code written to older versions of an interface

* Useful for providing *standard method implementations* for new interfaces
** Eases the task of implementing an interface

* When you extend an interface with a default method, you can:
** Not mention the default method at all, thus inheriting it
** Redeclare the default method, which makes it `abstract`
** Redefine the default method, which overrides it

=== Pitfalls

* *Avoid adding default methods to existing interfaces unless need is critical*
** No guarantee that they will work with existing implementations
** Existing implementations of an interface may fail at runtime
*** Can compile without error or warning

* *Cannot write default implementations of the `Object` class methods*
** Compiler error will forbid it
** Inheriting `Object` methods is strongly tied to single inheritance and state
*** Interfaces are multiple-inherited, and stateless
** Would add a lot of complexity for little incremental expressivity
** Well-intentioned, "harmless" changes to separately compiled interfaces
have potential to undermine the intended semantics of implementing classes

* Default methods were not designed to:
** Support removing methods from interfaces
** Support changing existing method signatures
** Neither of these changes are possible without breaking existing clients

<<<

== Abstract Classes vs. Interfaces

* Java has two mechanisms to define a type that permits multiple implementations
** Interfaces
** Abstract classes

* Abstract classes allow for:
** Abstract methods
** Default methods
** Constants
** Instance variables
** *Only single inheritance*
*** Severely constrains the use of abstract classes as type definitions
*** Can only use them if you inherit from them

* Interfaces allow for:
** Abstract methods
** Default methods
** Constants
** *Multiple inheritance*

<<<

== The Template Method Pattern

* Combines the advantages of interfaces and abstract classes

* Provides an abstract skeletal implementation class to go with an interface

* The interface:
** Defines the type
** Defines default methods

* The skeletal implementation class:
** Implements the remaining non-primitive interface methods atop the primitives

In this context, a *primitive*, is a basic interface or segment of code that
can be used to build more sophisticated program elements or interfaces.

=== Conventions

* By convention, skeletal implementation classes are named `AbstractINTERFACE`
** Where `INTERFACE` is the name of the interface they implement

* Examples in the Java API (Collections framework):
** `AbstractCollection`, `AbstractSet`, `AbstractList`, `AbstractMap`

=== Creating a Skeletal Implementation

. Study the interface and decide which methods are primitives
** In terms of which of the others can be implemented
** The primitives will be the abstract methods in the skeletal implementation

. Provide default methods in the interface
** For all methods that can be implemented directly atop the primitives
** Recall: You cannot provide default methods for `Object` methods
*** This includes `equals()` and `hashCode()`

. If the primitives and default methods cover the interface, you're done
** No need for a skeletal implementation class

. Otherwise, write a class declared to implement the interface
** With implementations of all of the remaining interface methods
** It may contain any non-public fields and methods appropriate to the task

<<<

== Javadoc

* Javadoc is a *documentation tool*

* Defines a standard format for comments

* Can generate HTML files to view the documentation from a web browser

* Can vary across platforms, vendors, and versions

* Used by API developers, especially to document interfaces

=== Usage

* Multi-line comments (`+/** ... **/+`) with two stars

* Placed before class, field, or method declarations

* Can include special tags to describe characteristics such as:
** Method parameters
** Return values

* Tags can be used at the end of a Javadoc comment
** Can provide more structured information about the code being described
** For example, `@param` can be used to describe the method's parameters
*** `@param` should be followed by the parameter name, and then a description

=== Example: Default Methods

[source,java]
----
public interface LotteryService {
    List<String> cancel(); // abstract method

    /**
    * Return the lucky winners of this lottery.
    *
    * @implSpec The default implementation will pick winners randomly.
    * @param count
    *           the number of winners to return
    * @return the (ordered) list of winners
    */
    default List<String> pickWinners(int count) {
       // ...
    }
}
----

* `@implSpec` is a Javadoc tag for default methods
("implementation specification")

* Provides informative notes about the implementation
** For example, performance characteristics specific to the JDK version

== Takeaways

* There is great risk in adding default methods to existing interfaces

* If an interface contains a minor flaw, it may irritate its users forever

* If an interface is severely deficient, *it may doom the API containing it*

* Critically important to *test each new interface before releasing it*

* Cannot count on correcting interface flaws after an interface is released
