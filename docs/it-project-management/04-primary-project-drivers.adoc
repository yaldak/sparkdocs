== Project Management Triangle

image::project-management-triangle{drawio-extension}[Grid]

* 3 components that influence quality: time, cost, scope

* When making heavy project decisions, you can pick two of these components to
define, but the third will be a "function of the other two components"

* For example, if given a schedule and scope, the cost will be the result of
those parameters

* If all three are defined, this is an **overdetermined system** (not feasible)

* Example primary driver: Cost
** Many projects are engineered to budget, especially in startup companies
(e.g. "here are 2 million dollars, what can we deliver?")

* Example primary driver: Scope
** Some project need scope and timeline defined, especially in startup companies
(e.g. "project cannot proceed without a prototype")
** Stakeholder identification influences scope

== Recall

* The business plan is the first attempt to get the size and the scope of the
project identified and agreement/disagreement from the major stakeholders

* The project charter has a lot more detail about what the deliverables are

* Project management consists of:
** What are we doing?
** How are we doing it?

* Is it worth redoing the business plan?
** If the project is approved in the first place, you are be "home free" and
would not want to go back to update the business plan
*** Except if an event occurs where one of the major assumptions that supported
the business case in the first place is no longer valid (for example, market no
longer exists)

* Scope creep
** Tackle by iterating (incremental approach)

* PMLC
** ... -> Project charter -> WBS -> Network diagram -> GANTT chart -> ...
** This middle bound is where the "rubber meets the road"

== Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

* A generic WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of a project into work
assignments, activities, and tasks

* Each block below is a decomposition (breakdown) of the element above it

* How deep can you go, and when will you be done?
** Up to the project manager
** Ensure that the units at each of block level are roughly of equal complexity,
duration, and size ("equal efforts")
** Really depends on the amount of control that you want to have on the project
** The finer the WBS, the more can be monitored (higher degree of scrutiny that
the PM can impose on the project)

* If, as a PM, you have worked with the team before and it is assumed they know
the steps well, you may not want to break down too deep
** But if there has been issues in the past, you may want to have more control
and include additional subtasks ("micromanage")

* The WBS should decompose the time frames into ever smaller chunks that can be
monitored into smaller tasks

image::wbs-levels{drawio-extension}[Grid]

* Can be set up by several mechanisms/organizing principles
** There is no right or wrong one, each has its own pros/cons based on the goal
** There can be some ability to mix/match into a hybrid

* WBS types
** WBS by Work Cycle
*** Driven by phases
*** You may not be able to necessarily adhere to the effort estimates in this form
** WBS by Subject Matter
*** Driven by expertise (SMEs)
** WBS by Deliverables
*** Driven by output components

- Objectives are best if they are SMART
S - Specific
M - Measureable
A - Agreed upon
R - Realistic
T - Timebound

Objectives are a superset of the goals

Ext: PMI PMBOK

PM Should not do heavy lifting. Recipe for disaster.

Project feedback: beware of too many features (project management triangle.)
