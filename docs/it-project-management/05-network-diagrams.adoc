== Recap

After creating the WBS, but before doing the work, you need to determine:

* Timeframes for each task

* Priorities for each task

This is where Network Diagrams come in to play.

== Definition

* *Network diagrams* help you determine and show the order in which tasks are
performed

* Also referred to as **PERT charts**
** "Program Evaluation & Review Technique"
** *Robust and reproducible*
** Developed in the late 50's by the US Navy for large projects
** NASA using them for Artemis 2024 moon mission

* Provides a *dependency analysis*
** When completed, it specifies the precedence/order in which events happen
** Specifies sequence and parallelism

* There is **no uniformly accepted notation** for network diagrams
** One form may lend itself better in certain situations

== Relationship to WBS

A network diagram is influenced by the WBS.

* If your WBS is structured by work cycle (phases):
** It is reasonable to assume that the order of events is given to you by the
activities at the activity level

* If your WBS is structured by subject matter or deliverables:
** It is by no means clear how to do the tasks or arrange them in a particular
sequence

* The Network Diagram represents your WBS at a certain level of decomposition
** Could be a precedence graph at any level of the WBS, e.g. activity level
** Eventually you decompose the activity level into tasks, so you can make a
network diagram at any level of the decomposition

Advantages: _Missing_

For example, the following activity set of a WBS makes the network diagram
structure obvious:

== Definitions

=== Activity vs. Event

* *Activity:* a distinct, scheduled portion of work performed during the course
of a project
** "Something you do"
** Consumes both time and resources
** In a network diagram:
*** An activity is represented by an arrow
*** The head of an arrow represents the start of activity __contradict__
*** The tail of arrow represents its end __contradict__

* *Event:* an occurrence or an outcome which is of significance
** "Something that happens"
** An event does not consume any time or resource
** A network diagram starts with an initial event and ends at a terminal event
** __Future research:__ Fulkerson's Rule
** In a network diagram:
*** Beginning and ending of an activity are represented as
events __contradict__
*** Each event is represented as a node

* *Task:* a subcomponent of an activity
** For the purpose of network diagrams, a task is treated as an activity

__factcheck__

=== Structures

* **Dummy task:** a task that does not consume resources
** It is a way to depict an event sequence without assigning resources to it

* *Burst point:* an activity that spawns off multiple activities in parallel
after it is completed

* *Sink:* a set of multiple activities that, when completed, spawn off
another activity

* *Float/Slack:* the difference between the latest start date and earliest
start dates is called the float or slack
** Number of days by which you can delay a non-critical task without impacting
the earliest completion time of a project
** Gives you tunable parameters as a manager

* *Critical Path:* the longest path through a network
** Due to this property, it represents the earliest completion time of a project
** *For critical path items, there is no slack*
** Any increment in the time of a critical path item immediately changes
duration of the project

== Application

__fixme__

If you decompose activities into tasks and have now assigned a duration or cost
for each of the tasks, as you aggregate those tasks to the activity level, the
times and the costs for the tasks also get aggregated upstream.

If you aggregate the times upstream, it will be difficult to compute the total
duration of the project, but you can compute effort (parallelism and man-hours)

== Variant 1

=== Legend

image:pert-variant-1-legend{drawio-extension}[Legend]

* Duration, written on the activity arrow, is indicated by a time frame
** The unit is chosen and consistent throughout the diagram
** In this example, the unit is days
** Applies to an activity or task

=== Example

image:pert-variant-1-example{drawio-extension}[Example]

Excerpt, explained:

* Once event 10 starts, activity A commences, and so on

* Once event 40 begins, 3 activities can commence (E, C, D)
** Upon completion of those events, event 50 happens

* A and B can only happen in sequence

* C and D can only happen in parallel upon completion of B

* 50 can only happen when C, D, and E are done

=== Critical Path

In this example:

* Subpath: A, B, C, F: 13 (total duration)
* Subpath: A, B, D, F: 12
* Subpath: A, B, E, G, H: 16 (**critical path**)
** Implies C and D - all tasks must be completed
* Subpath: A, B, C, G, H: __missing__

* Sum of durations in the critical path is 16
** Earliest completion time is therefore 16 days

=== Float/Slack

* When B is complete, we have used 4 days
** Complete B: Day 4. (we are at)
** Complete E: Day 9
** Start C: Day 4 / Complete C: Day 9 (Can start as late as 9-3=6)
** Start D: Day 4 / Complete D: Day 9 (can start as late as 9-2=7)

== Variant 2

__fixme__

=== Notes

* Trace a reverse path through the network to determine the LS and LF
** Start looking at EF of latest duration in the network

__unsure__:

* LF of last box = EF ? or 16 - EF?
* LS of last box = LF - DU ?

* Critical Path: X indicates activities where earliest = same = CP
** Cones without x have slack
** More formal method to determine critical path for complex network

* Walk a forward path to get earliest times
* Walk a backward path for latest times
