== Recap

After creating the WBS, but before doing the work, you need to determine:

* Timeframes for each task

* Priorities for each task

This is where Network Diagrams come in.

== Synopsis

* *Network diagrams* help you determine and show the order in which tasks are
performed

* Also referred to as **PERT charts**
** "Program Evaluation & Review Technique"
** *Robust and reproducible*
** Developed in the late 50's by the US Navy for large projects
** NASA using them for Artemis 2024 moon mission

* Influenced by the WBS
** If your WBS is structured by work cycle (phases),  it is reasonable to assume
that the order of events is given to you by the activities at the activity level
__checkme__ (before you do design)
** If your WBS is structured by subject matter or deliverables, it is by no
means clear how to do the tasks or arrange them in a particular sequence

* For example, the following activity set of a WBS makes the network diagram
structure obvious:

[plantuml, wbs-activity-example.generated, svg, align="center"]
----
@startuml
digraph foo {
    rankdir=LR;
    
    Concept -> Design -> Engineering -> Construction -> Testing -> Deployment;
}
@enduml
----

* Provides a *dependency analysis* such that, when completed, it specifies
the precedence/order of events in which events happen
** Specifies sequence and parallelism

== Notations

* There is no uniformly accepted notation for network diagrams
** One form may lend itself better in certain situations

==== Variant 1

===== Legend

image:pert-variant-1-legend{drawio-extension}[Legend]

* Duration, written on the activity arrow, is indicated by a time frame
** The unit is chosen and consistent throughout the diagram
** In this example, the unit is days
** Applies to an activity or task

===== Example

image:pert-variant-1-example{drawio-extension}[Example]

Excerpt, explained:

Once event 10 starts, activity A commences, and so on.

Once event 40 begins, 3 activities can commence (E, C, D). Upon completion
of those events, event 50 happens.

* A and B can only happen in sequence

* C and D can only happen in parallel upon completion of B

* 50 can only happen when C, D, and E are done

* **Activities are different than events**
** The events are not activities or tasks in the WBS
** Tasks are subcomponents of activities, but for the purpose of the diagram,
they are the same

* The Network Diagram represents your WBS at a certain level of decomposition

Advantages: _Missing_

Could be a precedence graph at any level of the WBS, e.g. activity level.
Eventually you decompose the activity level into tasks, so you can make a
network diagram at any level of the decomposition.

If you decompose activities into tasks and have now assigned a duration or cost
for each of the tasks, as you aggregate those tasks to the activity level, the
times and the costs for the tasks also get aggregated upstream.

If you aggregate the times upstream, it will be difficult to compute the total duration of the project, but you can compute effort.

===== Concepts

* A **dummy task** is a task that does not consume resources
** It is a way to depict an event sequence without assigning resources to it

** *Burst point:* an activity that spawns off multiple activities in parallel
after it is completed

* *Sink:* a set of multiple activities that, when completed, spawn off
another activity

===== Critical Path

The longest path through a network. Due to this property, it represents the
earliest completion time of a project.

In this example:

* Subpath: A, B, C, F: 13 (total duration)
* Subpath: A, B, D, F: 12
* Subpath: A, B, E, G, H: 16 (**critical path**)
** Implies C and D - all tasks must be completed
* Subpath: A, B, C, G, H: __missing__

* Sum of durations in the critical path is 16
** Earliest completion time is therefore 16 days

For critical path items, there is no slack
** In any increment in their time immediately changes duration of the project

===== Float/Slack

The difference between the latest start date and earliest start dates is called
the float/slack

Number of days by which can delay a non-critical task without impacting the
earliest completion time of a project

Gives you tunable parameters as a manager


* When B is complete, we have used 4 days
** Complete B: Day 4. (we are at)
** Complete E: Day 9
** Start C: Day 4 / Complete C: Day 9 (Can start as late as 9-3=6)
** Start D: Day 4 / Complete D: Day 9 (can start as late as 9-2=7)

==== Variant 2

===== Legend

* Trace a reverse path through the network to determine the LS and LF
** Start looking at EF of latest duration in the network

__unsure__:

* LF of last box = EF ? or 16 - EF? 
* LS of last box = LF - DU ?

* Critical Path: X indicates activities where earliest = same = CP
** Cones without x have slack
** More formal method to determine critical path for complex network

* Walk a forward path to get earliest times
* Walk a backward path for latest times
