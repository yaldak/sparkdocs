=== Recap

After creating the WBS, you need to determine:

* Timeframes for each task
* Priorities for each task

This is where Network Diagrams come in.

== Purpose

* Help you determine the order in which tasks are performed

* Also referred to as **PERT charts**
** "Program Evaluation & Review Technique"
** Developed in the late 50's by the US Navy for large projects
** NASA using them for Artemis 2024 moon mission

* Influenced by the WBS
** If your WBS is structured by work cycle (phases),  it is reasonable to assume
that the order of events is given to you by the activities at the activity level
** If your WBS is structured by subject matter or deliverables, it is by no
means clear how to do the tasks or arrange them in a particular sequence
** For example, the following activity set of a WBS makes the network diagram
structure obvious:

[plantuml, wbs-activity-example.generated, svg, align="center"]
----
@startuml
digraph foo {
    rankdir=LR;
    
    Concept -> Design -> Engineering -> Testing -> Deployment;
}
@enduml
----

* Provides a *dependency analysis* such that, when completed, it specifices
the precedence/order of events in which events happen
** Specifies sequence and parallelism

== Notations

* There is no uniformly accepted notation for network diagrams
** One form may lend itself better in certain situations

==== Variant 1

===== Legend

* Duration, written on the activity arrow, is indicated by a time frame

* A **dummy** task is a task that does not consume resources
** It is a way to depict an event sequence without assigning resources to it
