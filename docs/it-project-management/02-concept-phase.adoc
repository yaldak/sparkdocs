== Business Case

=== Basics

* Key deliverable of the concept phase

* Answers "What?" and "How?"

* Powerful document, but--surprisingly--not always created

* The PM may not be able to complete this document alone
** For example, support of financial or business analysts may be needed

=== Elements

The business case should specify:

* The **problem** to be solved

* The **goals and benefits** of the project

* The **objectives** of the project
** "What are we trying to accomplish?"

* The articulation the **needs and wants** of stakeholders
** Needs are must-haves
** Wants are optional; if delivered, they are often the excitement factor

* Potential project **scope**
** "What issues are we addressing?"
** "What issues are we NOT addressing?" (explicitly)
** There is no standardized format for this segment

* *Risks and impacts* to the environment

* A *cost-benefit analysis*

* A determination of *return on investment* (ROI)
** For the strongest argument, provide a determination of ROI against the
net-present value (NPV)

=== Template

. Business Case Overview
** Proposed Project
*** Narrative description of the proposed project (e.g. a paragraph)
** Project Mission
*** Can be short and succinct
** This overview section is the *core and essence* of the document

. Proposed Project Details
** Describe the problem to be addressed
** Goals and benefits
** Needs and wants of stakeholders
*** Template in this document
** Potential project scope
*** Also include issues/features/functions you do NOT plan to address
** Cost-benefit analysis
*** ROI determination (if possible)

. How the project supports:
** Corporate vision/missions
** Corporate goals/objectives
*** Can link to earlier parts of the document (helpful for larger projects)
** Indications of functional goals/objectives that come with the elements of
the project

=== About Templates
* Fortune 500 companies have their own project management methodology
** They provide their own templates

* In smaller companies, there may not be a uniformly accepted methodology
** The templates here (e.g. Needs and Wants) may be especially useful in
smaller companies.

== Project Drivers

Why do we actually do projects?

* Cost-reduction
** Often a primary motive
** Takes place in many different forms, such as lay-offs
** "How do we make things faster and cheaper?"
** The ROI vs. NPV analysis drills in on this

* Innovation

* Competitive advantage

* Risk diversification
** For example, avoiding vendor lock-in (Windows vs. Linux)

Some projects are not necessarily tailored for cost-reduction:

* The company may find it important to enter a new market sector

* Through innovation and competitive advantage, the long-term may yield payback

* The ROI analysis for the short-term may not be necessary in this scenario

<<<

== Needs and Wants

=== Basics

* Go through the stakeholder community and ask them for their needs and wants

* Needs are generally firm requirements

* Provide a high level estimate for the entire project cost and efforts (time)

* Used to estimate high level parameters and to start framing the issue

* Once completed, review with sponsors / stakeholders

* *Sponsor:* the person who has to pay for the initiative/foots the bill
(e.g. CEO)

* *Stakeholders:* beneficiaries of certain components of the system
(e.g. departments)

* Objective: Find a place that meets all must haves and as many others as
possible

=== Needs vs. Wants

==== Needs

* List with approximate dollar value associated (e.g. purchase cost, labor/time)

* Approx. price tag is an order of magnitude estimate, not precise
(e.g., $8, not $8.33)

* Useful to discover where the heavy hitting items are

* May be firm in the eye of the beholder (depending on clientele) - not up to PM

==== Wants

* List with approximate cost estimate

* Usually have a negotiable price

==== Example

Problem: I need a place to live.

Needs (must haves):

* 3 BR house
* 2,500 square feet
* 2 car garage
* 1-acre lot
* Large family room

Wants (negotiable piece):

* Room for a home office
* Basement

Nice to haves:

* Fireplace in the family room

<<<

== ROI

* *Return on investment (ROI):* a ratio between net profit and cost of
investment
** A high ROI means the investment's gains compare favorably to its cost
** As a performance measure, used to evaluate the efficiency of an investment
*** Can also be used to compare the efficiencies across different investments
** Numeric figure, but can also express period

=== ROI Analysis

* In financial terms, qualify what the benefits to the organization are if a
particular project is completed
** Financial pictures of a project's undertaking are powerful in corporate
contexts

* On the back of an envelope, sufficient to determine if the project should
move forward

* How can a financial picture be painted to convince oneself that a project is
worth undertaking or not worth it based on ROI?
** For example, ERP replacement
*** Rattles chains across the whole company, invasive project
*** Sometimes takes years
*** Is it worth it?

* How long will it take until I save net cash flow?
** That is, my balance sheet actually turns positive
** Important because there is additional cost I have to expend (work to be
done)

* To determine ROI, determine how far out in the future monthly savings will
offset the bubble cost the project incurred

* Total ROI period is the project implementation period
+ **the break-even period**
** If there is no break-even period, there will never be a positive ROI

=== Considerations

Considerations to make:

* Functional costs
** Critical and need to be stated

* Maintenance and support labor or fees

* Time value of money (e.g. inflation, interest rates)
* As time goes on and costs are incurred and benefits come in over a long
period, what is the life cycle of the cash cycle?

* When is money actually being expended or saved?

==== Net-present value (NPV)

* Since we need to make a decision "today", indication of how costs/benefit
are reflected in today's dollar

* Calculations
** Costs in and costs out are scaled to today's dollar
** Financial analysts should be involved

<<<

== Terms

* *Total Project Cost (TPC):* The sum, without duplication, of the engineering
cost and all project costs
** Also referred to as the *bubble cost*

* *Run Rate (RR):* A concept of how the financial performance of a company
would look if current results were extrapolated into future periods

* *Monthly Run Rate (MRR):* Cost the system imposes for an entire month
** May or may not be constant

* *Annualized Run Rate (ARR):* Cost the system imposes for an entire year
** If the MRR is constant: latexmath:[ARR = MRR \times 12]
** If the MRR is not constant, but discrete:
latexmath:[ARR = \sum_{i=0}^{12}MRR_i ]

* *Time Value of Money (TVM):* The concept that money available at the present
time is worth more than the identical sum in the future due to its potential
earning capacity
** Core principal of finance
** Provided money can earn interest, any amount of money is worth more the
sooner it is received

* *Equivalent monthly project cost:*
latexmath:[C = \frac{TPC}{\text{# of months in project lifecycle}}]

* *# of months to break even:*
** The number of months to break even, from implementation completion
latexmath:[M = \frac{TPC}{\text{Estimated monthly savings}}]

* *Total ROI Period:*
** The entire implementation period + the *break-even period*
** If there is no break-even period, there will never be a positive ROI

== Professor's Example

=== Time Value of Money Graph

image::professor-tvm-example{drawio-extension}[Graph,640,480]

* TPC = $500k
* MRR = $100k
* First year run rate = $100k (constant run rate of current solution)
* Second year run rate = $80k
* ARR = $100k * 12 = $1.2m
* Equiv. monthly project cost = $500k / 24 = $20,833
* $20k * x months = $500k
* x months until $20k is saved (break-even time)
* $20k = expected monthly savings

Red line ("every month we save $20k")

*fixme* # of months to break even = $500k/$20k = 25 months

Total ROI period = 24 + 25 = 49 months

What might be happening (month 0 -> n):

* Staffing up
* Buying equipment
* Buying project space
* Peak staffing (the constant line)
* Let developers go
* Let QA go
* Eventually (2 years later), let PMs go
