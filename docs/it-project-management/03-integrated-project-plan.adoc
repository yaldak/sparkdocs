== Introduction

* The business case is an attempt to collect as much information as possible to
the degree of accuracy that is possible at that stage of that project
** So that stakeholders can make an educated decision on if they will *move
forward*
** Used to determine if the stakeholders are serious about funding the project
or if it is just a "good idea" that will stay on the backburner

* Many ideas are rooted just by discussions "in the hall way", hence the
importance of the 30,000 foot view and the business case

* Many projects do not survive the business case phase

* ROI comparisons can be used to distinguish which project is higher priority
among others

* As you proceed through the PMLC, the information you present about work effort
and cost estimates becomes more detailed (especially in the WBS)

* Much of project management is **mechanical and straightforward**
** Many projects run by themselves
** The skills of the PM shine when things don't go to plan

* Typically a sign of immature business process and management if you go past
the business case and eventually kill the project (but it still happens)

== Integrated Project Plan

The *Integrated Project Plan (IPP)* consists of:

. Project Charter
** Risk Identification
** Assumptions
** Constraints (any that you can foresee)
** Primary project driver
** List of stakeholders

. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
** Risk planning and mitigation

. Logic Diagram
** Network diagram
** Event and precedence diagram

. GANNT Chart
** Scheduling tool: lays out sequential events, identifies dependencies, helps
reveal parallelism

. Cost Spreadsheet
** Picks up where ROI analysis left off; more detailed cost estimates

<<<

== Sign-off

The IPP culminates with a *sign-off:* formal agreements by the stakeholders and
sponsors to commit to the resources required to make the project happen.

It may be reviewed by non-stakeholders (e.g. other, tangential departments)

The sign-off covers:

* Project charter

* WBS

* Network diagram

* Precedence diagram

* Project schedule / GANTT chart

* Change management and communications plan

* Budget

* Risks and contingency plans

== Risk Analysis Grid

The following grid is useful for visualizing risks.

image::risk-analysis-grid{drawio-extension}[Grid]

* Quadrant I: Stay away -- no-win, or do in phases (move far out)

* Quadrant II: Pick your battles carefully
** If many items here, this is a "monster" -- do not overload the project
** Ensure great support, contingency/mitigation plans for these items

* Quadrant III: Do them all -- "mana from heaven"

* Quadrant IV: If you have time to kill, extra resources, or need a
reassurance/motivational boost for the team

<<<

== Project Charter Template

The typical project charter typically contains the following items. Based on the
size and scope of the project, some items can be collapsed or amplified.

* Vision statement (big picture/statement of intent)
** _Further research recommended_

* Project mission statement
** How do you instantiate the vision into actuality?
** Links to, but not necessarily restates, corporate vision and mission
** Can iterate from version in business case review phase
** Can make a reference to the anticipated scope (e.g. "worldwide")
** Can express intent (e.g. ambitious in nature, "best in class")

* Project goal statement

* Statement of scope
** Can include visualization

* Project objectives

* Critical success factors and measures
** Quantify factors with measures
** Factors are based off of the objectives (cascading, mutually supporting
relationships within the document)

* List of relevant risks

* List of assumptions

* Project constraints
** Include budget ceiling, for example

* Primary project driver

* Identification of all:
** Stakeholders
** Sponsors
** Clients/end users
** Other interested parties (e.g. 3rd-party vendors or PM office)

== Example Project Plan

Assume we want to create a project for an e-commerce websites that permits
international retail transactions.

*Project mission statement:*

To create and expand a worldwide Internet buying platform with name recognition,
ease of access and use, and a tech-savvy feel.

*Project goal statement:*

* A quirky, attention-grabbing website that helps navigate the selection and
purchasing steps

* An easy, secure purchasing mechanism that uses any currency and payment method

* Create "stickiness": e.g. a factor for the customer to return

*Scope:*

* Marketing (print & electronic safe), web & computer technology, required
financial functions, and client authentication functions

* Visualization:

image::example-project-visualization{drawio-extension}[Example]

*Project objectives:*

* Online purchasing is not time consuming

* Online purchasing has flexible payment methods

* Online purchasing must be usable by non-tech savvy users

* Users must know that their transactions are safe

* Language cannot be a barrier

*Critical success measures:*

* Payment transactions will complete in 10 seconds or less

* Customers may change their mind on the payment method mid-transaction

*Project risks:*

* Tech infrastructure may not be supported in some nations

* Not understanding expectations and financial patterns/buying behaviors of
overseas clients

* Possible local government intervention

*Project assumptions:*

* Project funding is established and available

* Hardware and software required for the project exists and is available

* We will accommodate cultural practices or preferences in some world regions

*Project constraints:*

* Budget ceiling has been established for this project: $2,000,000

* Any acquired software can be supported by in-house staff
** This is not necessarily easy

* Existing phone staff can accommodate internet orders

* Time to market must not exceed 1 year
