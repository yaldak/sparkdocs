Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could introduce a probabilistic approach that helps us determine the confidence we have that a particular task or project would be completed within a given period of time?

* Let latexmath:[T_e] = expected time for the completion of a task

* Let latexmath:[T_o]  = optimistic time for the completion of a
task

* Let latexmath:[T_p] = pessimistic time for the completion of a
task

* Let latexmath:[T_m] = most likely time for the completion

* Then, latexmath:[T_e = \frac{(T_o + 4T_m + T_p)}{6}]

What is actually happening here?

* You can use this to determine the confidence interval for your estimate
* Roots in statistic classes, sampling theories â€“ once you generate at least 6 data points of measurement, then you can assume that the sample size is following a "..."[19:17]
* You can determine the standard deviation / variance of these times

Standard deviation: 

latexmath:[\sigma(T_e) = \frac{(T_p - T_o)}{6}]

Let's assume the project we are working on is a server installation.

Server installation
Assume basically 3 activities:

* Procurement of server
* OS installation
* Software installation
* [WBS rooted at Server installation. These are the first 3 items at the first level.]

The tasks in these activities are pretty much in the control of the organization. People can usually give time estimates. For example: OS installation 2 days, SW installation 3 days. But what about procurement? It could be a big problem. Because the activities beneath it may not be under the control of the ordering organizations.

Possible subtasks for procurement:

* Prepare PO (1 days)
** Delivery dependent on inventory, shipping, logistics
** People may say from experience:
*** Delivery (2 days if available, 2 weeks if not, maybe even 4 weeks)
*** High degree of uncertainty
