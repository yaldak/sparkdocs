== PMLC

=== Basics

* *Project Management Lifecycle (PMLC):* series of phases of a project

* Activities yield deliverables/artifacts

* Although we can use agile methodologies, especially in the execution phase,
the PMLC lifecycle is largely *waterfall*

* Output documents add "`meat`" and accountability to the project
** Accountability helps determine if you are on track or in trouble
** The documents are artifacts of the project's existence
** Bad news: to go through the full PMLC, you have to create 5 documents
** Good news: there is a lot of overlap among these documents

* There is always a budget and you will have to balance needs

=== Steps in Managing a Project

. Define the problem

. Develop solution options

. Plan the project
  a. What must be done?
  b. Who will do it?
  c. How will it be done?
  d. When must it be done?
  e. How much will it cost?

. Execute the plan

. Monitor and control progress
  a. Are we on target?
  b. If not, what must be done?
  c. Should the plan be changed?

. Close project
  a. What went well?

  c. What else can we learn?

=== Four Phases of a Project

*** "What we will do, and what we will not do."
** Output: *project plan*
*** An operating plan for the project

. Execution & Control

*** Show progress and alert stakeholders of issues

. Close
** How do we deliver and move forward?
** Output: *lessons learned document*
*** Outlines what went well and what can be done better
